# BlobVerse ECS Scaffold - Progress Status

This document tracks the progress of the BlobVerse ECS Scaffold project.

## Completed Tasks

### Architecture

- [x] Implemented Node-Based Architecture
  - Refactored entity creation to use a single base `Node` entity
  - Created component-focused design with add/remove behavior approach
  - Implemented component-based visualization system
  - Added ZoneForce component for directional forces

### UI Modules

- [x] Implemented `toolbar.js` with entity creation tools

  - Added "+" Node button for base entity creation
  - Created component toggle sections (Forces and Behaviors)
  - Implemented entity selection and component attachment
  - Added visual indicators for selected entities

- [x] Implemented `paramPanel.js` with parameter adjustment tools
  - Created global parameter controls (Gravity Strength, Speed Multiplier)
  - Added entity statistics counter
  - Implemented entity selection and property editing
  - Added entity-specific controls based on component types
  - Added rule creation UI for defining entity interactions

### Engine Systems

- [x] Implement/complete render system

  - Added entity rendering based on transform and tag components
  - Implemented color-coding for different entity types
  - Added visual indicators for force field ranges
  - Added visual indicators for attractor/repeller types
  - Added component-specific visualizations for different entity behaviors

- [x] Implement/complete force system

  - Implemented force calculations between entities with ForceField components
  - Added inverse square and linear falloff options for force fields
  - Implemented attractor and repeller behavior
  - Added range-based force application
  - Added proper force scaling based on distance
  - Added ZoneForce component for directional forces

- [x] Implement/complete path system

  - Added PathTarget component for directional movement
  - Implemented two-step follower creation (place follower, then set target)
  - Added visual path indicator during target selection
  - Implemented arrival behavior (slowing down near targets)
  - Added support for waypoints for future extension

- [x] Implement/complete collision system
  - Added Collider component for collision detection
  - Implemented naive NÂ² collision checking algorithm
  - Added collision resolution (position correction and velocity reflection)
  - Integrated obstacle handling logic
  - Added collision event tracking for the rule system

### Game Logic

- [x] Add ruleSystem logic and wire into world.addSystem
  - Implemented collision-triggered rules
  - Added rule creation UI in parameter panel
  - Supported destroy and spawn actions
  - Added rule management (add/remove)

## Pending Tasks

### Game Logic

- [ ] Extend game logic (saving/loading)
  - Implement UI for save/load buttons
  - Connect serialization functions to UI
  - Test state persistence
  - Add URL sharing capabilities with lz-string compression

## Next Steps

The next priority is to implement the save/load functionality to allow users to save their simulations and share them. Following that, we can focus on polish items such as drag-to-select, undo/redo, and heatmap visualizations.

## Notes

- The new node-based architecture makes it easier to add new component types and behaviors
- Entities are now created as base nodes and users can add/remove components at runtime
- Force system now supports multiple force types (radial forces and zone/directional forces)
- Collision system now prevents entities from passing through obstacles
- Rule system allows for complex behaviors like destroying followers when they hit obstacles
- UI components are now functional but may need styling adjustments
- Path system now supports setting direction for followers, but could be extended with multiple waypoints in the future
