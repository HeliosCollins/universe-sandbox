# BlobVerse ECS Scaffold - Progress Status

This document tracks the progress of the BlobVerse ECS Scaffold project.

## Completed Tasks

### Architecture

- [x] Implemented Node-Based Architecture
  - Refactored entity creation to use a single base `Node` entity
  - Created component-focused design with add/remove behavior approach
  - Implemented component-based visualization system
  - Added ZoneForce component for directional forces

### UI Modules

- [x] Implemented `toolbar.js` with entity creation tools

  - Redesigned with icon-only interface and tooltips
  - Created status display showing current mode/selection
  - Implemented component-focused interface that emphasizes node unification
  - Improved visual feedback with selection highlights
  - Added clear section headers to organize functionality

- [x] Implemented `paramPanel.js` with parameter adjustment tools
  - Created global parameter controls (Gravity Strength, Speed Multiplier)
  - Added entity statistics counter
  - Implemented entity selection and property editing
  - Added entity-specific controls based on component types
  - Added rule creation UI for defining entity interactions

### Engine Systems

- [x] Implement/complete render system

  - Added entity rendering based on transform and tag components
  - Implemented color-coding for different entity types
  - Added visual indicators for force field ranges
  - Added visual indicators for attractor/repeller types
  - Added component-specific visualizations for different entity behaviors

- [x] Implement/complete force system

  - Implemented force calculations between entities with ForceField components
  - Added inverse square and linear falloff options for force fields
  - Implemented attractor and repeller behavior
  - Added range-based force application
  - Added proper force scaling based on distance
  - Added ZoneForce component for directional forces

- [x] Implement/complete path system

  - Added PathTarget component for directional movement
  - Implemented two-step follower creation (place follower, then set target)
  - Added visual path indicator during target selection
  - Implemented arrival behavior (slowing down near targets)
  - Added support for waypoints for future extension

- [x] Implement/complete collision system
  - Added Collider component for collision detection
  - Implemented naive N² collision checking algorithm
  - Added collision resolution (position correction and velocity reflection)
  - Integrated obstacle handling logic
  - Added collision event tracking for the rule system

### Game Logic

- [x] Add ruleSystem logic and wire into world.addSystem
  - Implemented collision-triggered rules
  - Added rule creation UI in parameter panel
  - Supported destroy and spawn actions
  - Added rule management (add/remove)

## Pending Tasks

### Game Logic

- [ ] Extend game logic (saving/loading)
  - Implement UI for save/load buttons
  - Connect serialization functions to UI
  - Test state persistence
  - Add URL sharing capabilities with lz-string compression

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement spatial partitioning for collision and force systems
  - Replace naive O(n²) checks with spatial grid or quadtree
  - Optimize for large numbers of entities
  - Add grid visualization option for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Implement save/load functionality to allow users to save and share simulations
2. Add spatial partitioning for better performance with many entities
3. Add more component types (Wander, Flocking behavior, etc.)
4. Improve selection controls (multi-select, delete selected)
5. Add visual enhancements (heat-map visualization, trail effects)

## Notes

- The new icon-based toolbar with tooltips provides a cleaner, more intuitive interface
- The node-based architecture makes it easier to add new component types and behaviors
- Entities are now created as base nodes and users can add/remove components at runtime
- Force system now supports multiple force types (radial forces and zone/directional forces)
- Collision system now prevents entities from passing through obstacles
- Rule system allows for complex behaviors like destroying followers when they hit obstacles
- Path system now supports setting direction for followers, but could be extended with multiple waypoints in the future
